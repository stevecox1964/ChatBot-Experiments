# ChatBot-Experiments
Python ChatBot using Python AIML and Google Cloud Speech apis

NOTE: !!!!!!!!! You will need a Google account and speech api installation working before the Talking_BOT will work. Please read up on how to get the Google Python cloud to speech apis installed in your machine. Please don't ask me to get the code working for you.

First try to get the chatbot.py to run by installing python Aiml
Search for: Install Aiml package python

Once you can get the chatbot aiml app working, then search Google for how to
install google Cloud to Speech and Peach to Cloud apis. Try out Googles speech api examples before trying the get the talking bot to work.

You are also going to need to get pygame and pyaudio installed. Please don't try and run the software and ask me to fix it for you. These examples are complicated just do to all the dependancies.

Thanks and have fun !!!!!!
